Parallel Workflow Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Parallel Workflow pattern
for consensus building, validation, and multi-perspective analysis.

Use cases:
- Critical decisions requiring multiple expert opinions
- Consensus building and error reduction
- Multi-perspective analysis and synthesis
- Quality validation through redundancy
