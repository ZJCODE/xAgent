Meta Memory Demo

This example demonstrates how to use the LocalMemory component's meta memory extraction 
feature. Meta memory provides high-level insights and patterns derived from recent 
memories, helping to understand user context and behavioral patterns.

            1. Set clear boundaries between work and personal time
            2. Take regular breaks during the workday
            3. Use your lunch break to step away from your desk

            5. Schedule regular physical activities (like your weekend hikes!)
            6. Practice mindfulness or meditation
            7. Delegate tasks when possible
            8. Communicate openly with your team about workload
