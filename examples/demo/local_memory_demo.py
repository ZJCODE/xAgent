üìã Summary:
- Stored 5 different types of memories (profile, episodic, procedural, working, semantic)
- Demonstrated automatic memory type classification and tagging
- Showed semantic search capabilities across different memory types
- Tested retrieval precision with specific queries

üîß Key Features Demonstrated:
‚úÖ Automatic memory extraction from natural language
‚úÖ Intelligent memory type classification
‚úÖ Semantic similarity search with ChromaDB
‚úÖ Metadata tracking (timestamps, tags, user association)
‚úÖ Support for multiple memory types (WORKING, PROFILE, EPISODIC, SEMANTIC, PROCEDURAL)

üöÄ Next Steps:
- Try storing more complex conversations
- Experiment with different query types
- Integrate with Agent for automatic memory storage during conversations
