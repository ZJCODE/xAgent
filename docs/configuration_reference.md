## Basic Configuration

### Minimal Configuration

The simplest configuration file for a basic agent:

```yaml
agent:
  name: "MyAgent"
  system_prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant."
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini"

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8010
```

### Standard Configuration

A more comprehensive setup with common features:

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Assistant"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a helpful AI assistant with access to web search and image generation.
    Always provide accurate and helpful responses.
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini"
  
  capabilities:
    tools:
      - "web_search"      # Built-in web search
      - "draw_image"      # Built-in image generation
    mcp_servers: []       # MCP server URLs (optional)
  
  message_storage: "local" # or "redis"

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8010
```

## Agent Configuration

  port: 8010         # Port number
```

## Multi-Agent System Configuration

### Hierarchical Multi-Agent Setup (Agent as Tool)

Create a coordinator agent that delegates to specialized sub-agents:

#### Coordinator Agent (coordinator.yaml)

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Coordinator"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a coordinator agent that delegates tasks to specialists.
    - For research tasks, use the research_agent
    - For writing tasks, use the write_agent
    - Always choose the most appropriate specialist for each task
  model: "gpt-4.1"

  capabilities:
    tools: []
    sub_agents:
      - name: "research_agent"
        description: "Research specialist for information gathering"
        server_url: "http://localhost:8011"
      - name: "write_agent"
        description: "Writing specialist for content creation"
        server_url: "http://localhost:8012"

  message_storage: "local"

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8010
```

#### Research Specialist (research.yaml)

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Research Agent"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a research specialist focused on gathering accurate information.
    - Use web search to find current and reliable sources
    - Verify information from multiple sources when possible
    - Present findings in a clear, structured format
    - Always cite your sources
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini"

  capabilities:
    tools:
      - "web_search"

  message_storage: "local"

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8011
```

#### Writing Specialist (writer.yaml)

```yaml
agent:
  name: "Writing Agent"
  system_prompt: |
    You are a professional writer specializing in clear communication.
    - Create engaging, well-structured content
    - Adapt tone and style to the intended audience
    - Ensure proper grammar and readability
    - Organize information logically
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini"

  capabilities:
    tools: []

  message_storage: "local"

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8012
```

### Starting Multi-Agent Systems

```bash
# Start sub-agents first (bottom-up approach)
xagent-server --config research.yaml > logs/research_agent.log 2>&1 &
xagent-server --config writer.yaml > logs/writing_agent.log 2>&1 &

# Start coordinator agent
xagent-server --config coordinator.yaml > logs/coordinator_agent.log 2>&1 &

# Verify all agents are running
curl http://localhost:8010/health  # Coordinator
curl http://localhost:8011/health  # Research agent
curl http://localhost:8012/health  # Writing agent
```

## Structured Output Schema

Define Pydantic models directly in configuration for structured responses:

### Schema Configuration Format

```yaml
agent:
  output_schema:
    class_name: "ResponseModel"  # Generated class name
    fields:
      field_name:
        type: "field_type"       # str, int, float, bool, list
        description: "Field description"
      list_field:
        type: "list"
        items: "str"             # Required for list fields
        description: "List description"
```

### Supported Field Types

- `str` - String values
- `int` - Integer numbers
- `float` - Decimal numbers
- `bool` - Boolean true/false
- `list` - Arrays (requires `items` field)

### Example: Content Report Schema
